Note: This projet supports database connectivity which works with XAMPP. The data entered in form after ordering is saved in the table. XAMPP is configured locally and hence will not work when this website is viewed from hosted Github Pages.

Database name: db_wp_semiv

Table name: orders

Columns: name, contact, address, upi [All Varchar]

The config file in main directory XAMPP should be modified to read files from root folder of this repo instead of htdocs. Dashboard and img folder were copied from htdocs to this repo.
